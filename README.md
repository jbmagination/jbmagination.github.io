# Website
my website looks kinda cool doesn't it

ok cool

ill probably revise this readme soon

## Site Directory

* Under the `.well-known` folder is my Brave Rewards verification. This means if you visit my website, you can pay me BAT if you use the Brave Browser.
* Under the `background` folder is a file that renders a green gradient background. I use this in my streams!
* The file `keybase.txt` is used to verify my Keybase account. Currently, it doesn't work for some reason-- I'll get it fixed soon!
* The file `html5shiv.js` is actually the file `html5shiv-printshiv.min.js`. It allows the HTML5 and CSS that runs in the browser to work on older browsers, such as Internet Explorer.
* The files `.nojekyll` and `_config.yml` are used to help GitHub Pages show the `brave-rewards-verification.txt` file, and for Brave Rewards to recognize it.
* The file `style.css` actually makes the site look good. Woah.
* The file `index.html` is what you see when you visit https://jbmagination.com!
