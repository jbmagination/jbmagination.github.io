* Under the `.well-known` folder is my Brave Rewards verification. This means if you visit my website, you can pay me BAT if you use the Brave Browser.
* Under the `background` folder is a file that renders a green gradient background. I use this in my streams!
* The file `keybase.txt` is used to verify my Keybase account. Currently, it doesn't work for some reason-- I'll get it fixed soon!
* The file `html5shiv.js` is actually the file `html5shiv-printshiv.min.js`. It allows the HTML5 and CSS that runs in the browser to work on older browsers, such as Internet Explorer.
* The files `.nojekyll` and `_config.yml` are used to help GitHub Pages show the `brave-rewards-verification.txt` file, and for Brave Rewards to recognize it.
* The file `style.css` actually makes the site look good. Woah.
* The file `index.html` is what you see when you visit https://jbmagination.com!
* The file `CNAME` allows you to be able to see the website at https://jbmagination.com. Othwerwise, you'd see it at https://jbmagination.github.io, which isn't as cool.
* The file `README.md` is what you're seeing right now. It won't appear this way on the website, though, because of `.nojekyll`.
* The files `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` are used for SEO (search engine optimization). Basically, the website should rank higher than it did before.
* The file `humans.txt` is part of an initiative ran by [Humans TXT](http://humanstxt.org), to know who has created, or helped create, a website-- and it's used by [Google](https://www.google.com/humans.txt), [Discord](https://discord.com/humans.txt), [Slack](https://slack.com/humans.txt), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/humans.txt), [Tumblr (who uses it as a very clever text adventure)](https://www.tumblr.com/humans.txt), [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/humans.txt), [GitHub (which redirects to github.com/about)](github.com/robots.txt), and many more.
