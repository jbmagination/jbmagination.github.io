    <h1>Hello, Pretendo! <i style="font-size:50%">...I am not a web designer</i></h1>
    <p>I'm keeping this page as a list of my contributions to Pretendo, and my Pretendo Network IDs.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm JBMagination, or JBM for short. I go by she/they, I'm non-binary, and I do a lot of things that you probably don't care about. I think that's all you need to know!</p>
    <h2>Pretendo Network IDs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>JBMagination</b> - My main Pretendo Network ID. I am currently locked out of it until password resets are implemented. There is a matching Nintendo Network ID on the same console (which I did using a lot of very dangerous filesystem shenanigans).</li>
      <li><b>JBMaginationPNID</b> - My alternate Pretendo Network ID. I created it specifically because I'm locked out of <b>JBMagination</b>, but it will probably stick around as an alternate account.</li>
      <li><b>PretendoDocs</b> - A Pretendo Network ID I made for the purposes of contributing to documentation. I am glad to hand over this ID to anyone on the Pretendo Network development team (although you probably don't need my permission to do that.)</li>
      <li><b>ConflictingNNIDP</b> - I created this ID as a way to test if the filesystem shenanigans I did on <b>JBMagination</b> actually worked, by doing it again with this one. I think it's the first instance of successfully creating and using a matching Pretendo Network ID and Nintendo Network ID on the same console.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Contributions to Pretendo</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I am currently contributing to documentation. You can see what I'm up to on that front <a href="https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/website/pull/181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
      <li>I became the first person to make a matching Pretendo Network ID and Nintendo Network ID on the same console! I plan to make a guide on how to do this soon. When I do so, I'll link it here and post it in the Discord.</li>
    </ul>
