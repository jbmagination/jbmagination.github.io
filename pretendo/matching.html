    <h1>Making and using a matching Nintendo Network ID and Pretendo Network ID on the Wii U</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The Wii U doesn't let you do this by default, which is why there are countless people telling you <i>not</i> to do this.</p>
    <p>Also, if you don't fear messing around and breaking things (as in, rendering your console unusable), then perhaps don't do this. This will involve modifications to SysNAND, or your system's internal storage. Be careful!</p>
    <p>Lastly, this guide assumes that you've setup Aroma on your Wii U, with the FTPiiU plugin, as well as the bleeding edge version of Inkay as per the instructions <a href="https://pretendo.network/docs/install/wiiu">here</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Creating your Nintendo Network ID</h2>
    <p>Booting into the Wii U Menu, press (L)+(D-Pad Down)+(Select) on your GamePad to enter the Wii U Plugin System menu.</p>
    <p><img src="" /></p>
    <p>Select Inkay, then Patching, then set "Skip Pretendo Network patches" to false.</p>

    <p>Exit the menu, and wait for the Wii U Menu to load. Get to the user selection screen, make your user and Nintendo Network ID as usual, yada yada.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><i>The fun part</i>, part 1</h2>
    <p>Time to play brick roulette! No but seriously be careful. <b>You should only be doing this if you know what you're doing.</b></p>
