<h1>How to play Mario Kart Wii online</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>You will need:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Either a Wii or Wii U</p>
<p>An SD card with at least 1 GB of space</p>
<p>A computer</p>
<p>A Mario Kart Wii game disc</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Chapter 1: Setting up your SD card</h3>
<p></p>
<p>1. Make sure your SD card is empty. If it isn't, you may want to put the contents in a folder somewhere (such as your Desktop).</p>
<p>2a. If you are using Windows, download the tool <a href="http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/guiformat.exe">fat32format</a>.</p>
<p>2b. If you are using macOS, open Disk Utility from the Launchpad.</p>
<p>3. Look at the list. Keep in mind what drives are listed.</p>
<p>4. Insert your SD card.</p>
<p>5. Look at the list again, and look for the one that wasn't there before.</p>
<p>6. Format it as FAT32 (or "MS-DOS (FAT)" on macOS).</p>
<p>7. Download the .zip file available <a href="https://github.com/jbmagination/jbmagination.github.io/releases/download/mkw1/mkw-online.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>8. Extract the contents to the root of your SD card (it shouldn't be inside any folder).</p>
<p>9. Your SD card is now set up.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Chapter 2: Starting the Installer</h3>
<p></p>
<p>1. Insert your SD card into your Wii.</p>
<p>2. On your Wii, go into Wii Options (in the bottom-left hand corner).</p>
<p>3. Go to Wii Settings.</p>
<p>4. Go to Internet.</p>
<p>5. Go to Connection Settings.</p>
<p>6. Select the connection you're currently on.</p>
<p>7. Change the settings.</p>
<p>8. Once you are on Auto-Obtain DNS, select No, and click Advanced Settings.</p>
<p>9. Put the primary DNS as 97.74.103.14, and the secondary DNS as 173.201.71.14.</p>
<p>10. Confirm, save, then run a connection test.</p>
<p>11. Say No to the system update.</p>
<p>12. Back in the Internet section, head to User Agreements (or Agreement/Contact), then say "Yes".</p>
<p>13. If you see a pony on a light-blue background, you have done it correctly.</p>
<p>14. Do not click "I AGREE" or "I DO NOT AGREE" and wait on that screen for 1-2 minutes.</p>
<p>15. If your Wii freezes or does not continue after at most five minutes, please restart your Wii and try again.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Chapter 3: Setting up Wiimmfi</h3>
<p></p>
<p>1. Wait 30 seconds, then press 1.</p>
<p>2. Continue, and install the Homebrew Channel.</p>
<p>3. Continue, then exit.</p>
<p>4. Exit to the system menu.</p>
<p>5. Start Mario Kart Wii from the Disc Channel.</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>5. If you're on Wii U, and it bugs you, you can run the Aspect Ratio Fix app and stretch it out to the intended 16:9 instead of 4:3.</p>
<p>5a. If you're on Wii, run and load the Wiimmfi Competition Patcher for Wii, then exit. This only needs to be run once, and the Wii will automatically be redirected to Wiimmfi's servers for competitions.</p>
<p>5b. If you're on Wii U, run and load the Wiimmfi Competition Patcher for Wii U, then exit. You will need to run this every single time you want to play a competition, as the Wii U does not support WiiConnect24.</p>
<p>6. After 6 hours, the Wiimmfi competitions will be enabled.</p>
