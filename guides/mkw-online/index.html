<p></p>
<p>Either a Wii or Wii U</p>

<p>A Mario Kart Wii game disc</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Chapter 1: Setting up your SD card</h3>
<p>1. Go to <a href="https://please.hackmii.com">please.hackmii.com</a>. It looks phishy, but I can assure you it is perfectly safe to use.</p>
<p>2. Turn on your Wii, and go to "Wii Options".</p>
<p>3. Go to Wii Settings.</p>
<p>4. Go to Internet.</p>
<p>5. Go to Console Information.</p>
<p>6. On the webpage, put in the MAC Address shown on your Wii console.</p>
<p>7. Cut whichever wire you want (it's just a little joke).</p>
<p>8. Make sure your SD card is empty. If it isn't, you may want to put the contents in a folder somewhere (such as your Desktop).</p>
<p>9a. If you are using Windows, download the tool <a href="http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/guiformat.exe">fat32format</a>.</p>
<p>9b. If you are using macOS, open Disk Utility from the Launchpad.</p>
